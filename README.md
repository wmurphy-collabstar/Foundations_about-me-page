# Foundations: About Me page for Alex David
## Overview
This project was a chance for me to learn about another Innovation Fellowship peer and craft a web page featuring details about them while also using their story and personality to design the webpage. To make a more detailed About Me, I split up the page into a Professional and Personal About Me section so one can get a more well-rounded glimpse of Alex and who he is. 

My goal was to take design ideas that Alex wanted (including a more intricate background, and funny tone) along with the facts I learned about him, and turn them into a webpage that would make people want to get to know Alex even more.

## Features
- A header featuring the title of my site in a casual font
- A Profesional About Me section that includes three pictures reflecting his hometown, tech interests and professional values, and a detailed summary of who Alex is, his tech skills and/experience, and a silly quote (for fun)
- An Personal About Me section that includes three pictures reflecting Alex's favorite place, his passions, and something he believes in, and a more personal summary of Alex's passions, favorite things and goals
- A footer containing photo credits for each image

## Design
I decided on a three-color palette based on Alex's deep interest in animals and the rainforest. His favorite color is #3e6958 (which is a dark blue green), so I made a contrast between a darker version of that color (#2A473B) and beige (#F5F5DC). These colors together give the vibe of camoflauge based on natural forestry. I tried to incorporate Alex's favorite color wherever I could to make the site truer to himself. 

I wanted to show the dichotomy of a professional versus a personal about me section, so I made the professional section in a light mode, and the personal section a dark mode to give that contrast. The contrast reminds me of the juxtaposition of day and night, where in the day people typically work and at night they rest. I also love light and dark mode options on websites, and wanted to incorporate that feel even without an interactive light/dark mode toggle powered by Javascript.

The tone of the About Me section titles and text is light-hearted on purpose, as Alex wanted a fun page. Adding GIFs was also a chance for me to make an About Me go from a normally serious tone to a lighter, more fun tone.

A fun challenge for me was making the page more intricate. I decided on some kind of pattern in the background to steer away from a minimalist look, and ended up really liking the faded shapes in the background. I also added gradients to the images to make them detailed but in line with the color scheme of the page. 

Finally, I experimented with picking different fonts to convey different modes, leaning towards a font similar to Georgia (or serif fonts) for a more professional feel, and a handwritten font (or sans-serif fonts) for a more casual touch. 

All in all, this project gave me a chance to design a page to represent someone else and their preferences, and I learned a lot from this experience ðŸ˜Š
