                <p class="intro about-me-paragraph black-border"> <span>I'm from Queens, born and raised. Shout out to everyone in Queens!</span>
                    <span>I live in the suburbs closer to Long Island. I love to wake up before the sunrise to plan out my day.</span>
                    <span>I used to be a vegetarian, but sadly no more.</span><span>Currently a student and a TKH Fellow (yeah TKH!), and honestly I'm an open book. Anytime you wanna chat, 
                    <a href="#">DM me here.</a></span></p>
                <p class="tech-skills about-me-paragraph black-border">
                    <span>I'm currently pursuing my Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.</span>
                    <span>I'd say my strongest skill is communication. I can say a persuasive elevator pitch, no problem.</span>
                    <span>Because of my past experience in standup comedy, I have the confidence needed to present my ideas and try new things.</span>
                    <span>I love to fail because with failure comes growth. After receiving many job application rejection emails, "unfortunately" is now my favorite word.</span>
                    <span>From my upbringing, I learned the fruits of discipline, and running towards challenges.</span>
                    <span>If you want somebody that believes in following their potential and challenging the status quo, I'm your guy. </span>
