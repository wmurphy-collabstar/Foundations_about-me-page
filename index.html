                <p class="intro about-me-paragraph position-relative"> <span>Alex is a Queens, NYC native.</span>
                    <span>He lives in the suburbs closer to Long Island, and loves to wake up early to plan out his day.</span>
                    <span>He used to be a vegetarian, but sadly isn't one anymore.</span><span>Currently a student, a TKH Fellow (yeah TKH!), and an open book. You can ask him anything...</span></p>
                <p class="tech-skills about-me-paragraph position-relative">
                    <span>Alex is currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.</span>
                    <span>His strongest skill is communication. He can give a persuasive elevator pitch, no problem.</span>
                    <span>Because of his past experience in standup comedy, Alex has the confidence needed to present ideas clearly and step out of his comfort zone.</span>
                    <span>Alex loves to fail because with failure comes growth. After receiving many job application rejection emails, <em>unfortunately</em> is now his favorite word.</span>
                    <span>From his childhood, he learned the reward that comes from running towards challenges, and actively seeks them out.</span>
                    <span>If you want somebody that believes in following their potential and challenging the status quo, Alex David is your guy. </span>

                <p class="passions about-me-paragraph position-relative">
                    <span>Alex is a music lover, through and through. After playing violin for a year, he now has his own guitar and plans to learn how to read sheet music.</span>
                    <span>Alex's biggest passion is his love for animals. He has read over 120 encyclopedias, which really says it all. Even his Grandma thought he could go on Oprah with his knowledge.</span>
                    <span>Steve Erlwin was his hero as a kid, and one of his favorite places is the Amazon Rainforest. He often went to Guyana to see family, and loved hiking and fishing in the rainforest there.</span>

                <p class="favorites about-me-paragraph position-relative">
                    <span>His favorite collection of movies is the Planet of the Apes franchise, from the 1970s version to present.</span>
                    <span>Alex's favorite book is <em>Gregor the Overlander</em> by Suzanne Collins, as he loves the world of big insects and animals.</span>
                    <span>He also believes in Bigfoot, and has a little figurine of Bigfoot at home.</span>
